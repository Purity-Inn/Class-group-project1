    <p style="background-color: maroon;">Nyawira says even the greatest parents of them all <br>don't have a manual when it comes to parenting<br> and motherhood. "I always say it is God because<br> you can only do much. I always say as a

    <p style="background-color: rgb(9, 137, 9);">"I can't tell you to get pregnant at 22 but if you<br> happen to have a stable man and you have gotten <br>to a point where you feel that life is good,<br> sometimes i say yeah getting a kid at a young age <br>it is a good thing.</p>
