<title>President John Magufuli's presidency</title>

<h1 style="color:red;">Hon John Magufuli presidency
</h1>
<p>

Magufuli was sworn into office as the fifth President of the United Republic of
<B>Tanzania</B> on <B><i>5th November 2015 </B></i>at Dar es Salaam, soon after the Tanzanian
delegation to IAFS-III had returned from Delhi. Magufuli was the official candidate
of the ruling CCM party<i style="color:blue;">(founded by the iconic Julius Nyerere),</i> which has been
continuously in power since <B>1961</B>, the longest ruling party in Africa. He won the
presidential contest held on 25th October by a much reduced margin of 58%
against the combined opposition candidate’s much improved showing of about 40
per cent of the votes polled. In effect, Magufuli represents a party on the decline in
the Tanzanian people’s perception, but one that could still prop up a winning
candidate due to the candidate’s clean image, the party’s superior organizational
structure, particularly in Tanzania’s vast rural and semi-rural areas, and the not
so clean image of Edward Lowasa, the challenger who had crossed over to the
opposition after failing to win the CCM’s nomination.<BR>

 President Magufuli started his Presidency on
<B><i>5th November </B></i>on a note different from that of any of his predecessors and in
defiance of age old practices. While PM Modi revealed his master stroke in getting
<B>SAARC </B>and neighbourhood leaders to attend his swearing in ceremony in May
<B><i>2014,</B></i> Magufuli swept away some of the pomp and pageantry surrounding the
Tanzanian Presidency thereby effecting savings of precious resources to be used for
more urgent public tasks. A few days after his swearing in, Magufuli showed up at
the principal referral hospital in Dar es Salaam and found patients lying on the
floor, in the absence of adequate beds, and key equipment dysfunctional. The
director of the hospital was promptly removed and money sent to the hospital to get
beds and equipment repaired. A visit to a department office revealed large scale
absenteeism, which he promptly rectified. By these actions, the Tanzanian
President signalled to the people that it was not going to be business as usual,
particularly in the delivery of public services, a woe that afflicts the country
seriously.<BR>
Magufuli opened the 11th Parliament <i style="color:blue;">(Bunge)</i> located at Dodoma, which is the
official capital of Tanzania, about 500 kms from Dar es Salaam, on 11th November.
He did three things differently from his predecessor. He travelled by road to
Dodoma from Dar es Salaam, which continues to host the State House or the office
of the President and most ministries, and did not take the Presidential aircraft for


this and other official tours. His speech, though of about 90 minutes duration, was
much shorter than that delivered earlier by his predecessors, and he cut down the
budget allocated for the State Dinner that normally follows the inauguration of the
new parliament by 90 per cent, and diverted the money thus saved, about<B> Tsh 200
million</B> or over <B>USD 90,000,</B> for hospital and healthcare augmentation facilities. In
his inaugural speech, Magufuli said, “….it was now time for Tanzanians to walk the
talk in the resolve to confront vices that he said were holding the nation back in
uplifting millions from abject poverty.”1 Among the drawbacks listed by Magufuli
are mega corruption, embezzlement of funds within local governments, poor
management and sheer waste of resources, including natural wealth, bureaucracy
in government offices, negative political competition, neglect of strategic
infrastructure investments, and a culture that encouraged laziness or did not
reward hard work. The President said that “...poverty and unemployment remained
Tanzania's biggest challenges….”2 He promised better education, water supply,
healthcare delivery and expanded economic opportunities for all. The President told
Parliament that his government will concentrate on improved railway, port and air
infrastructure. Gas discovery will help the nation leap forward. Industrialization,
particularly the manufacture of clothes, textiles, edible items and other agro-based
industries, is a key to his plans. Magufuli said that he hoped manufacturing would
account for 40 per cent of all new jobs .<BR>

According to same report, “The president warned that he will not hesitate to fire
any of his ministers implicated in corruption...”3 A CNN report of <B><i>14 January 2016</B></i>
is headlined “John Magufuli, the no frills President who declared war on waste.”4
Among his first decisions after taking office was to ban the purchase of first and
business class tickets for foreign travel by ministers and officials, except the
President, the Vice President and the Prime Minister. In general, he has asked
senior functionaries to avoid foreign travel, get their work done through the
ambassadors and high commissioners posted abroad and to visit rural areas more
often to understand the problems of the people at the grassroots level. At the
inaugural session of parliament, Magufuli gave a hint of the problem of waste,
claiming that between 2013 and 2015, foreign trips cost the country a staggering
Tsh 356.3 billion<B style="color:maroon;">[USD 163 million approximately]</B> in air tickets and allowances
alone. “This money could build 400 kms of tarmac roads,” he noted.<BR>
[Magufuli was
the Minister for Works from 2010 to 2015 under President Kikwete, and even in an
earlier period, was responsible for road construction, which earned him the
nickname 'the duckworth' or 'The Bulldozer' for pursing to completion what he
started]. Government has banned official meetings and workshops to be held in
hotels, which now must be held in government buildings. On the economic front,
Magufuli ordered a review of all privatization contracts and businesses which
private investors have failed to revive. As a start, recently, the government
announced that it is repossessing five sisal estates that had been leased to private
investors who have failed to keep them running. He promised to tackle Tanzania's
endemic power shortage, end the ad hoc grant of tax holidays to businesses and
projects, and increase the number of businesses that are paying taxes. On the
education front, Magufuli promised more funds for free primary and secondary
education and to concentrate on teachers' salary and housing problems, which
have, in the recent past, brought the education sector to a standstill.<BR>
Magufuli wants to find a middle path for the political logjam in Zanzibar, the semiautonomous coastal region, which merged with mainland Tanganyika in 1964 to
form a unique federal structure styled as Tanzania. Elections to the presidency in
Zanzibar were held at the same time as that of the Union presidency elections in
October 2015. However, the election outcome remains suspended due to
differences between the main political actors of the island about the election
process that has not been resolved to this day. Magufuli also promised that
Tanzania will play its part in enhancing regional integration in the East African
Community<B> (EAC)</B> and the Southern African Development Community<B> (SADC).</B>
Significantly, Magufuli has been quoted as telling parliament that Tanzania will be
“...constructively engaging with its development partners to keep the good record of
his predecessor.”<BR>
Tanzania gained independence from British suzerainty on 9 December 1961. Each
year this event is celebrated with great pomp including a mass parade and
demonstration at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam and a grand reception
hosted by the President at the State House. Last year, Magufuli cancelled the
Independence Day parade and reception and instead held a National Day of
Cleanliness, on which day Magufuli himself wielded the broom, a la Modi. The
budgeted expenditure of USD 1.9 million was instead diverted for expanding a
congested road and for street cleaning.<BR>
Magufuli's war against corruption and public waste has been relentless since he
took charge of the fate of Tanzania over two months ago. A Cabinet was formed and
announced only in early<B><i> December 2015</B></i>, a full month after his assumption of
office, the delay perhaps caused by a drastic reduction in the number of ministers,
from 30 in previous President Kikwete's Cabinet to only 19 this time, by merging
and clubbing ministries. A low key CCM functionary was appointed as Prime
Minister, in contrast to the expectation that a high profile politician well versed in
party machinations would be appointed to take care of party-government relations,
leaving Magufuli, who was not known earlier to have waded much in the party's
internal matters, free to concentrate on governance issues. Only a handful of
Kikwete's ministers could find place in the new cabinet selected by Magufuli, giving
grist to the rumour mill that he wants to make a fresh start without interference
from the previous reg


 Magufuli promptly sacked the port authority head and
suspended the Tanzania Revenue Authority <B>(TRA) chief</B>. The head of the anticorruption bureau was also given marching orders.<BR>
President Magufuli's “...radical reforms have the region in awe” -- so says the 'News
24' portal. According to CNN, the reformist President has inspired one of the
country's most enduring and popular hashtags – #WhatWouldMagufuliDo. It has
also inspired a new verb, 'Magufulify', defined as (i) to render or declare an action
faster or cheaper, (ii) to deprive <B>[public officials]</B> of their capacity to enjoy life at
taxpayers' expense; and (iii) to terrorize lazy and corrupt individuals in society.8
Within the EAC, Tanzania is often blamed as a slow starter in reforms, particularly
economic reforms which will help integrate the region into a common economic
entity. Magufuli's social and governance reforms have catapulted the country into a
trend setter for the region and possibly all of sub-Saharan Africa to emulate and
follow. Among the five EAC countries, three <i>(Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi)</i> have
broken the political code of not more than two consecutive terms for the incumbent
Head of State, with drastic internal, regional and continental ramifications. Kenya
is racked by political rift and violence often based on tribal fault lines. While
Tanzania may still be carrying some past socialist baggage <i>(nationalization of
businesses and properties)</i>, on the matter of political stability, maturity and smooth
transition of power it is the numero uno in the region, a fact it has been touting to
attract foreign investment. Magufuli's unusual governance tactics may well give
Rwanda's Kagame a run for his money on the issue of transparency and clean
governance as well.<BR>
